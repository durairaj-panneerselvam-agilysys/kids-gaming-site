# Kids Gaming Site

A fun, interactive, and educational gaming site for kids ages 10â€“15. This project is designed for learning web development, branding, and theming.

## How it works
- Branding, theme, and games are driven by JSON files in `data/`:
  - `branding.json`: logo, slogan, contact, social links
  - `theme.json`: color palette, font
  - `games.json`: site title, tagline, countdown, games list
- All content and styles update automatically when you edit these files.

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit files in `data/` to see changes live (refresh page).
3. Customize images in `assets/images/` and icons in `assets/icons/`.

## Learning Checkpoints
- Look for `TODO: student exercise` comments in code for extension ideas.
- Try adding a new game, changing the theme, or updating branding.
